@article{Azizyan2011,
abstract = {Today, little is known about what tools software companies are using to support their Agile methods and whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with them. This is due to lack of objective surveys on the subject. The surveys that have been conducted so far are of a subjective nature and have mostly been performed by tool vendors. They are very limited in number and focus mainly on company structure and adherence to a specific Agile method rather than on tool usage and needs. For this reason, many companies have difficulties to choose appropriate tools to support their Agile process. One such company is the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. To account for this lack of data, Ericsson commissioned us to conduct an independent survey focusing on the tool usage and needs as experienced by the Agile software community today. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey. The survey covers 121 responses from 120 different companies coming from 35 different countries. Our results show that the most satisfactory tool aspect is ease of use, whereas the least satisfactory one is lack of integration with other systems. Finally, our results provide a list of features that are most desired by the software companies today.},

@article{Asnawi2012,
abstract = {Agile methods are an established process for developing software nowadays. There is, however, less evidence on its usage among software practitioners in Malaysia. While the methods have become mainstream in other regions, that is not the case in this country. This paper empirically investigates the perceptions of Agile methods usage from seven organisations involving 14 software practitioners in Malaysia. Our participants are using Scrum and have a maximum of five years experience. We categorised our findings in terms of awareness, introduction, and challenges they are facing, together with the suggested and practiced solution from them. Interestingly, a change in mind set when practicing Agile was identified to be helpful in reducing the challenges. Lastly we present the practices in Agile they perceived to deliver the most benefits. We found that the use of Agile is still emerging in the country, and awareness is still lacking especially within the government sector. Although several challenges have been encountered when introducing Agile in their organisations, the benefits of Agile are reported to be in Agile practices such as: the involvement from all parties from the beginning, daily stand-up meeting, iterative and incremental, applying burn down chart, sprint and continuous integration. We aim to provide awareness and knowledge about Agile methods to the practitioners in the country and the nearby region. This paper can serve as a reference to the early adopters who intend to use Agile methods in the future.},

abstract = {Agile methods are an established process for developing software nowadays. There is, however, less evidence on their usage among software practitioners in Malaysia. While the methods have become mainstream in other regions, that is not the case in this country. This paper investigates important aspects in relation to Agile usage in Malaysia. The study was conducted using a questionnaire with 207 software practitioners from the country. Non parametric analysis (Chi-Square test) was conducted to investigate the relationship of Agile usage with (i) language, (ii) place of education and (iii) organization types. Results showed Agile usage has significant association with the two aspects; (i) language and (ii) organization types. It is suggested that these two aspects must be taken into consideration if one organization plans to adopt the methods. The results also revealed that many of the Agile users are not being exposed to the method before they start using it. We aim to provide knowledge and evidence on the suitability of Agile methods to the people in the country and nearby region.},

@article{Bahli2011,
abstract = {Agile development methods have emerged to overcome some of the process and product-related problems associated with traditional models. They are believed to be lightweight, people focused, adaptive and allow better information systems development (ISD) performance. Nevertheless, they require a significant capacity of absorbing new set of skills, knowledge and mindset changing. When using agile methods IS developers are faced with a challenge to quickly assimilate the mindset of these new methods and develop the ability to recognize information and apply it in context. This paper reports on two ex-post ISD project implementation. We integrate a central construct in the dynamic capability theory - absorptive capacity to explain agile method adoption and usage. The findings show that absorptive capacity, indeed, plays an important role in adopting and using agile method-Extreme Programming model. The implications of these findings for both researchers and practitioners are discussed.},

@article{Laanti2013,
abstract = {Little research data exist about agile teams and wellbeing. After changing our software engineering mode to agile, we wanted to find out if people experienced more or less stress than before. This study is based on a company-wide survey of 466 software engineering practitioners. We asked about their subjective feelings about stress, empowerment, and performance in their respective engineering teams after they had started to use agile methods. The results reveal that the feelings of higher performance improvement and sustainable pace are related, and that this difference is statistically significant. Respondents who feel that their team is empowered also feel less stress. However, no significant difference in feelings of stress and empowerment was found between respondents working in Kanban and Scrum mode after transition to agile. The group that was improving its performance because of agile was also reporting a better workload balance. The group that was experiencing worse performance because of agile methods was also more stressed. The differences may be explained by the management styles being practiced in the teams. The results are important as those verify in industrial setting what some agile books suggest: limiting workload and team empowerment has an impact on performance and stress. This contributes to our understanding how agile teams should be managed.},
