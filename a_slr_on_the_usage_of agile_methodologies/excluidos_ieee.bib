abstract = {Earlier empirical studies have demonstrated the interest that agile methods have generated in the software industry. Currently, lean approaches are increasingly adopted for complementing agile methods in software processes. With the goal of providing up-to-day results that can be used by organizations implementing or planning to implement agile and/or lean methods, we have conducted a study on the current stage of agile and lean adoption and usage in the software industry. For this purpose, we conducted an extensive survey among Finnish software practitioners in 2011, using the membership registry of The Finnish Information Processing Association (FIPA)as a sampling frame. 408 responses were collected from 200 software intensive organizations in the study. The survey included questions for identifying the rate of agile and lean usage in software organizations as well as the implementation of specific methods and practices, goals in adopting agile and lean, reasons for not applying these methods and effects of the agile and lean usage. The results of the survey reveal that a majority of respondents' organizational units are using agile and/or lean methods (58{\%}). Furthermore, lean appears as a new player, being used by 24{\%} of respondents, mainly in combination with agile (21{\%}). The reasons and benefits for using agile and lean methods appeared to correspond in most parts to the findings of the earlier research. Generally, the experiences of using agile and lean methods seem to be rather positive, although challenges, such as obtaining management support and limitations for scaling agile in distributed settings, were also identified.},

This complexity emerges from the higher degree of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve and from the evolution of the functionalities implemented by the applications. The Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), a document review investigation has taken place with the objective to compare SOA development with two highly used agile software development methods: Extreme Programming (XP) and Relational Unified Process (RUP). The motor behind this investigation is to see if this agile development methods are capable enough to design effectively and efficiently SOA type applications. The investigation concluded that both methodologies are not exactly suited to create SOA applications, but RUP has a greater chance to provide SOA type applications if the proper adjustments are made, specially on the design side of the methodology. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on identifying the important aspects of Agile adoption from software practitioners in Malaysia. We analyse 27 Agile adoption variables from a survey of early Agile users in Malaysia. Factor analysis is conducted to identify the clusters of the variables (or items) and how they are inter-related to produce factors. Most of the respondents are from software organisations in Kuala Lumpur and Selangor; in which most of the companies are located in Malaysia. The clusters of variables resulting from this analysis can serve as a reference to the practitioners planning to adopt the methodology. The top factors identified from this study are shown in terms of (i) developer involvement and organisation-related aspects, (ii) cultural and people related aspects and (iii) customer collaboration and the need for professional skills when using Agile methods. In addition, factor analysis discovered that practitioners disagreed about the importance of the technical aspects of Agile. While we believe that these findings are particularly important from the Malaysian perspective, however, they also help add to the body of evidence in the field of software engineering and software process particularly in terms of Agile methods adoption. Moreover, the study also can help adopters from the nearby geographical regions to understand and see the suitability of Agile methods for their organisations.},

abstract = {oftware developers and testers have to work together to achieve the goals of software development projects. In globally distributed software projects the development and testing are often scattered across multiple locations forming virtual teams. Further, the distributed projects are so complex that none of team members can possibly possess all the knowledge about the project individually. During testing in such teams, developers and testers need to coordinate and communicate frequently. However, coordination is affected by the availability of the project information, which is distributed among different project members and organizational structures. Many companies are facing decisions about how to apply agile methods in their distributed projects. These companies are often motivated by the opportunities of solving the coordination and communication difficulties associated with global software development. In this paper we investigate the communication between testers and developers in two teams from two software companies performing continuous agile testing in a distributed setting. We describe four communication practices used by the team: handover through issue tracker system, formal meetings, written communication and coordination by mutual adjustment. We also discuss communication between testers and developers in collocated versus distributed testers and developers. We have found that early participation of the testers is very important to the success of the handover between testers and developers. The communication between developers and testers is not sufficiently effective through written communication and that it changes depending on the type of the tasks and experience of the testers.},

As most decisions today are based on data collected by Information Systems (IS), the IS itself must become more adaptable. This is particularly challenging in the domain of Business Intelligence (BI) Systems since the underlying architectural approach of enterprise-wide decision support systems is not build upon agility, but on reliability and robustness over a period of time. In order to determine the agility of BI, a unique understanding of agility and its underlying criteria is required. This paper provides a literature review which aims to summarize the known criteria from IS literature that can be applied to the domain of BI. The results can be interpreted as a framework for understanding the agility of BI systems and form the basis for generating mandatory criteria for assessing agility. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Available : Eero Retrieved : 27 ABSTRACT Context : Continuous delivery (CD) is a development prac - tice for decreasing the time - to - market by keeping software releasable all the time . Adopting CD within a stage - gate managed development process might be useful , although sci - entific evidence of such adoption is not available . In a stage - gate process , new releases pass through stages and gates protect low - quality output from progressing . Large organi - zations with stage - gate processes are often hierarchical and the adoption can be either top - down , driven by the manage - ment , or bottom - up , driven by the development unit . Goal : We investigate the perceived problems of bottom - up CD adoption in a large global software development unit at Nokia Networks . Our goal is to understand how the stage - gate development process used by the unit affects the adop - tion . Method : The overall research approach is a qualitative single case study on one of the several geographical sites of the development unit . We organized two 2 - hour workshops with altogether 15 participants to discover how the stage - gate process affected the adoption . Results : The stage - gate development process caused tight schedules for development and process overhead because of the gate requirements . Moreover , the process required us - ing multiple version control branches for different stages in the process , which increased development complexity and caused additional branch overhead . Together , tight sched - ule , process overhead and branch overhead caused the lack of time to adopt CD . In addition , the use of multiple branches limited the available hardware resources and caused delayed integration . Conclusions : Adopting CD in a development organiza - tion that needs to conform to a stage - gate development pro - cess is challenging . Practitioners should either gain support from the management to relax the required process or reduce their expectations on what can be achieved while conform - ing to the process . To simplify the development process , the use of multiple version control branches could be replaced with feature toggles .},

Although a consensus within literature exists about the demand for agile BI systems, a structured overview on how such systems can be developed is missing. Closing this research gap, the paper at hand presents a catalog of Agile BI actions which is based on a comprehensive literature review. It includes 21 assessed actions suitable to increase the agility of BI systems. Therefore the catalog provides benefits to scientists (identification of research areas) as well as practitioners (identification of sophisticated actions for implementation). It consists of the four action categories ‘principles', ‘process models', ‘techniques', and ‘technologies'.},

This paper reports on the findings of such research conducted within the context of a large technology-focused case organisation. The findings identify significant variance between business lines, specifically between product development and software development functions and their ability to follow agile guidelines. Generally across the organisation there was limited evidence of tailoring to context, an important organisational success factor, yet there was a more significant level of tailoring and responsiveness to client needs and wishes. Overall, there was a lack of clarity about the location of the decoupling points following the scoping of the project. Recommendations therefore require further attention and understanding of the implications of new practices employed by organisations, not least by senior management and for additional research underpinning such discovery.},

abstract = {Agile Software Development has been around for more than a decade. Over this period, the focus of applications, problems and consequently research themes has been changed dramatically. However, the main efforts have been arguably yielded to employ agile development in large and distributed environments. This imposes sophisticated needs to deal with e.g. project definition and management in such environments, as well as techniques and methods for communication, coordination, collaboration, etc., and even, the resulting cultural and organizational problems. This paper provides a systematic literature review in which main problems and themes of agile software development in large organizations, systems or projects and/or in distributed teams and environments have been sought and classified. The source of data is limited to IEEE publishing whether conferences or journals, and from 2005 onward. The results show that the major problems chronologically began with issues of cultural readiness, method implementation/adoption and project management, and then for the most recent years, the emphasis has been mainly switched to quality management as well as communication and collaboration mechanisms. Meanwhile, the results also reveal that indeed large organizations are even more eager and pioneer to transition to agile development due to their high degrees of cost as well as competitiveness. This fact paves the way to use their valuable, early experiences for other large as well as medium and small teams and organizations particularly those who have not switched yet. The study ends up with a few predictions for the future of agile development research themes in large and distributed environments.},

abstract = {Agile software development has been attached much importance as a new software engineering methodology as it emphasizes on good communication between the developers, the rapid delivery of software, and change on demand. The metrics and methods from conventional lifecycle models cannot predict accurately for agile projects. We have proposed a new cost estimation model for agile software development projects. In this model we apply Principal Component Analysis to reduce the dimensions of the attributes required and identify the key attributes which have maximum correlation to the development cost; and then use constraint solving approach to satisfy the criteria imposed by agile manifesto. The proposed methodology is found to bet suitable for agile projects as it uses constraint programming to explicitly check for satisfaction of agile manifestos. On comparison with other approaches under research we find that our model provides a low MMRE value i.e.50.63. Our methodology can also be used in case of unavailability of historical data or expert opinion. Hence we can safely say that the proposed cost estimation approach increases the precision and accuracy of estimates; and hence is better suited for the Agile Software Development Projects.},

abstract = {—Feature models are a key element in software product lines, representing the supported features and their interrelationships within a family of software products. Rec-ommendation systems for software engineering (RSSEs) are potentially useful in supporting the extraction, maintenance, and categorization of feature models. This paper focuses on the design and implementation of an RSSE to automatically recommend features for software product lines, the types of these features, and how they could be related to each other. Such a recommender should save time and tedium over doing the work manually. We present FFRE, a prototype recommendation tool for the extraction of features and their relationships from software requirements specification (SRS) documents. FFRE is based on natural language processing (NLP) techniques and heuristics. FFRE is evaluated qualitatively from four SRS documents and compared against other tools and approaches.},

@article{Murphy2013,
abstract = {Abstract—Background. The pressure to release high-quality, valuable software products at an increasingly faster rate is forcing software development organizations to adapt their development practices. Agile techniques began emerging in the mid-1990s in response to this pressure and to increased volatility of customer requirements and technical change. Theoretically, agile techniques seem to be the silver bullet for responding to these pressures on the software industry. Aims. This paper tracks the changing attitudes to agile adoption and techniques, within Microsoft, in one of the largest longitudinal surveys of its kind (2006-2012). Method. We collected the opinions of 1,969 agile and non-agile practitioners in five surveys over a six-year period. Results. The survey results reveal that despite intense market pressure, the growth of agile adoption at Microsoft is slower than would be expected. Additionally, no individual agile practice exhibited strong growth trends. We also found that while development practices of teams may be similar, some perceive and declare themselves to be following an agile methodology while others do not. Both agile and non-agile practitioners agree on the relative benefits and problem areas of agile techniques. Conclusions. We found no clear trends in practice adoption. Non-agile practitioners are less enamored of the benefits and more strongly in agreement with the problem areas. The ability for agile practices to be used by large-scale teams generally concerned all respondents, which may limit its future adoption.},

abstract = {Universities are under increasing pressure to provide real world experience to students. Entrepreneurial courses are prevalent in business schools and have been shown to develop entrepreneurial skills. Entrepreneurial skills are equally important in the development of IT innovations. The research in this area of education is not as prevalent. We argue that Agile Software development methods, along with other key course characteristics enable students to learn entrepreneurial skills related to IT product development and do so in an environment where innovation can flourish. We present some preliminary data, which demonstrates some success in the course in developing entrepreneurial skills, with a particular focus on the use of Agile Development and mentoring methods in developing those skills.},

@article{Druk2013,
abstract = {The Fit framework is a widely established tool for automated acceptance test-driven development (ATDD). Fit stores the test specification separate from the test fixture code in an easily human readable and editable tabular form in HTML format. Additional tools like the FitPro plugin or FitN esse support the writing of test specifications and test fixtures from within the Eclipse IDE or the Web. With the increasing popularity of agile test-driven software development, maintenance of the evolving and growing test base has become an important issue. However, there has been no support yet for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. In a recent research project, we developed the Eclipse plugin ReFit for automated refactoring of Fit test cases. Fit test refactoring can occur due to changing requirements or changing Java code, which in either case means a cross-language refactoring to keep test specification and test fixture in sync. In this paper the concept for the development of the ReFit Eclipse Plugin is described, which significantly reduces the effort for Fit test maintenance and makes refactoring less error prone. Besides a tight integration into the existing Eclipse refactoring plugin, major goals of the plugin were to make it easy extensible for additional refactorings, new fixture types and further test specification file formats. Challenges faced when adding new and modifying existing Eclipse refactoring behavior are described and are due to the strong dependency on the Eclipse JDK and LTK features, and the solutions developed are presented.},
