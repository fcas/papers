abstract = {There is a wide area of applications that use embedded systems, and the number of such systems keeps growing. The required functionality and complexity of embedded systems are also constantly increasing, and development of such products is becoming increasingly harder. This requires new thinking on the product development processes, and one such emerging philosophy is the agile methods. These methods were created by the software engineering community where they are commonly used. Since then, they have been adopted in embedded systems development; however, whether they can improve the embedded systems product development processes remains an open question. This study aims to bring forth what is known about agile methods in embedded systems development and to find out if agile practices are suitable in this domain and what evidence is there to support the findings. We conducted a literature review and a mapping study to answer these questions. The scope of this study is not only limited to embedded software development, but also to embedded hardware and integrated circuits. We have found that agile methods can be used in the embedded domain, but the methods and practices need to be adapted to suit the more constrained field of embedded product development. Furthermore, the field of embedded product development has wide diversity of products with different needs and domain-specific problems so that no single method is applicable, but rather many methods and practices are needed for different situations.},

@article{Borges2011,
abstract = {Abstract— In the last decades we have been witnessing a significant increase in the complexity inherent to software development projects, due not only to a higher degree of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve, but also to the natural evolution of the features implemented by the available software systems and applications. However, the reduced dimension of many software corporations imposes a significant constraint to the group of individuals that might be involved in each project, with obvious consequences to their efficiency and effectiveness. This paper describes how to accomplish a configuration of the Rational Unified Process (RUP) in order to obtain one set of RUP roles that, without neglecting any critical role of the software development process, may easily be adopted by a small or medium software development team during the project execution period. Keywords: RUP, small software teams, SME, RUP tailoring. I. INTRODUCTION Now more than ever, the software development industry is being put to the test, as a joint result of several stress factors. First, we have been witnessing a significant increase in the complexity inherent to software development projects, due not only to a higher degree of sophistication in the contexts they aim to serve, but also to the natural evolution of the out-of-the- box features offered by the myriad of available technologies and software systems. On the other hand, the ever growing importance of reducing time-to-market decreases the error margins, boosting the pressure applied on the teams to deliver better software in less time. Finally, the rise of strong international players based on developing countries (like India, China, Pakistan, etc) boosted competitiveness, given their technological maturity (attaining the highest levels of the CMM – Capability Maturity Model [1] scale) and cost advantages (due to the considerably lower wages). Since, SMEs (Small and Medium Enterprises) [2] urge for methodologies with the potential to help them cope with the challenges faced, arouse from the low level of process standardization, RUP (Rational Unified Process) [3] presents itself as a useful reference, given the wide set of roles proposed to structure software development teams. However, in spite of its alleged easy customization process, there's a lack of RUP configurations suited for micro (employing less than 10 people) and small companies (employing less than 50 people) [2]. Thus, this paper aims to help small scale organizations by Paula},

Adequate tool support may pave the road to effective risk management and ensure the sustainability of such activity. In this paper, we present the RISCOSS platform for managing risks in OSS adoption. RISCOSS builds upon a highly configurable data model that allows customization to several types of scopes. It implements two different working modes: exploration, where the impact of decisions may be assessed before making them; and continuous assessment, where risk variables (and their possible consequences on business goals) are continuously monitored and reported to decision-makers. The blackboardoriented architecture of the platform defines several interfaces for the identified techniques, allowing new techniques to be plugged in.},

From the 45 found publications, the search strategy identified 11 studies and 3 methodological proposals: Athena, K-gileRE and NORMAP.

[Principal ideas/results]: We conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with twelve experts. The experts work on the coordination of Business and IT and describe their experiences gained in 69 large-scale IT projects. The analysis of our interviews showed that direct user- developer communication is limited and that no commonly used method for the user-developer communication in the design and implementation activity exists.
