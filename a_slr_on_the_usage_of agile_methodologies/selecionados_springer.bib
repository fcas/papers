@article{Asnawi2011,
abstract = {Agile Methods are a set of software practices that can help to produce products faster and at the same time deliver what customers want. Despite the benefits that Agile methods can deliver, however, we found few studies from the Southeast Asia region, particularly Malaysia. As a result, less empirical evidence can be obtained in the country making its implementation harder. To use a new method, experience from other practitioners is critical, which describes what is important, what is possible and what is not possible concerning Agile. We conducted a qualitative study to understand the issues faced by early adopters in Malaysia where Agile methods are still relatively new. The initial study involves 13 participants including project managers, CEOs, founders and software developers from seven organisations. Our study has shown that social and human aspects are important when using Agile methods. While technical aspects have always been considered to exist in software development, we found these factors to be less important when using Agile methods. The results obtained can serve as guidelines to practitioners in the country and the neighbouring regions.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen significant changes in systems development with many organizations adopting agile methodologies as a viable methodology for developing systems. An increasing number of research studies reveal the growing popularity and acceptance of agile methodologies. While most academic research has focused on adoption and adaptation of agile methods, there is very limited understanding of their post-adoption usage and incorporation within organizations. What factors explain the effective usage of agile methodologies? A synthesis of past research in Systems Development Methodologies, Information Systems implementation, Diffusion of Innovations, and Agile Methodologies was conducted to develop a research model that identifies the main factors pertinent to the propagation and effective usage of agile methodologies in organizations. The model is tested by applying it to the usage of Kanban for Software Engineering practices at BBC Worldwide, London. Insights gained from the case study are discussed. 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {Agile software development methods are commonly customized to a specific need, such as usage or adaptation of agile practices. In order to identify which agile practices organizations are using, we performed a systematic mapping study. Objective: In this paper, our goal is to present the generalizable state of the practice in agile practices usage. Method: We used tri- angulation of these study data and the data of the state of agile development survey related to agile practices usage. Results: This comparison shows similar results; obvious deviations and contradictions are discussed. Conclusion: The results of the triangulation of the two studies can be considered as an initial ge- neralizable state of the practice for the usage of agile practices. Keywords:},

@book{Solinski2016,
abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant shift from rigid development (RD) toward agile. However, it has also been spotted that agile methodologies are hardly ever followed in their pure form. Hybrid processes as combinations of RD and agile practices emerge. In addition, agile adoption has been reported to result in both benefits and limitations. This exploratory study (a) identifies development models based on RD and agile practice usage by practitioners; (b) identifies agile practice adoption scenarios based on eliciting practice usage over time; (c) prioritizes agile benefits and limitations in relation to (a) and (b). Practitioners provided answers through a questionnaire. The development models are determined using hierarchical cluster analysis. The use of practices over time is captured through an interactive board with practices and time indication sliders. This study uses the extended hierarchical voting analysis framework to investigate benefit and limitation prioritization. Four types of development models and six adoption scenarios have been identified. Overall, 45 practitioners participated in the prioritization study. A common benefit among all models and adoption patterns is knowledge and learning, while high requirements on professional skills were perceived as the main limitation. Furthermore, significant variances in terms of benefits and limitations have been observed between models and adoption patterns. The most significant internal benefit categories from adopting agile are knowledge and learning, employee satisfaction, social skill development, and feedback and confidence. Professional skill-specific demands, scalability, and lack of suitability for specific product domains are the main limitations of agile practice usage. Having a balanced agile process allows to achieve a high number of benefits. With respect to adoption, a big bang transition from RD to agile leads to poor quality in comparison with the alternatives.},

abstract = {The number of success stories being reported concerning agile software development has led to an increase in interest among industries and research communities. The purpose of this paper is to identify strengths and barriers for 'successful agile deployment' in the software companies. This knowledge can benefit software companies planning their current strategy for agile deployment. Analysis of 57 developers, architects, project managers, customers, quality managers, and line and product managers in three case companies identifies 71 strengths and 169 barriers of agile deployment. The analysis revealed the importance of management providing the necessary goals and support for agile development. It also indicated the significance of defining a tailored process model and giving developers the freedom to improve their own agile development process continuously during agile deployment. The identified barriers, strengths and recommendations can be used as a checklist for planning and/or monitoring the effectiveness of agile deployment in software companies. By identifying the barriers and strengths of agile deployment, the paper deepens understanding of this highly relevant but relatively under-researched phenomenon and contributes to the literature on agile deployment and software process improvement. {\&}copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},
