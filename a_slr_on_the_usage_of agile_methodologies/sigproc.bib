abstract = {Context: Although agile software development (ASD) method use has grown dramatically in recent years, there is lack of empirical evidence for their effective use and predicted improvements in software development. This suggests that there is an imprecise understanding of their use and practice in organisations beyond the adoption phase. There is a lack of clarity on what 'usage' or 'effectiveness' mean in the context of ASD. In particular, the relationship between agile usage and agile effectiveness has not been investigated. Objective: To study the factors that impact usage of ASD methods and analyse the relationship between post-adoption use of ASD methods, i.e. agile usage and the results effectively achieved in terms of improvements in development outcomes, i.e. agile effectiveness. Method: An agile usage model of post-adoption or continued agile usage is tested using a survey instrument. The study employs variance-based or partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) implemented in SmartPLS version 2.0. Special attention is given to the quality of the measures used by developing reliable and valid measures of study variables. Results: The results from a partial least squares (PLS) analysis shows that relative advantage and agile coach significantly influence the usage of agile methods. Results also support the thesis that agile usage as measured by intensity and extent of agile method use significantly impacts agile effectiveness. Conclusions: The overall contribution of this research is to improve the effectiveness of ASD methods by increasing the likelihood that ASD methods will be effectively used and sustained beyond the adoption phase.

abstract = {Agile Methods are a set of software practices that can help to produce products faster and at the same time deliver what customers want. Despite the benefits that Agile methods can deliver, however, we found few studies from the Southeast Asia region, particularly Malaysia. As a result, less empirical evidence can be obtained in the country making its implementation harder. To use a new method, experience from other practitioners is critical, which describes what is important, what is possible and what is not possible concerning Agile. We conducted a qualitative study to understand the issues faced by early adopters in Malaysia where Agile methods are still relatively new. The initial study involves 13 participants including project managers, CEOs, founders and software developers from seven organisations. Our study has shown that social and human aspects are important when using Agile methods. While technical aspects have always been considered to exist in software development, we found these factors to be less important when using Agile methods. The results obtained can serve as guidelines to practitioners in the country and the neighbouring regions.},

abstract = {While past research has contributed to the understanding of how organizations adopt agile methodologies (AM), little is known about their post-adoptive usage in organizations. By integrating theories from systems development methodologies, diffusion of innovations, and agile methodology literature, this paper proposes a new model that identifies a set of critical factors pertinent to post-adoptive usage of agile practices. This model is used to inform analysis of post-adoptive usage of agile practices in two major organizations. The results indicate relative advantage, team attitude and technical competence, championing, and top management support (TMS) are the key factors determining the extent to which agile practices can be assimilated into an organization. Specifically, both findings and this model confirm that the deeper the assimilation of agile practices into the organization, the better understanding of how assimilation leads to specific improvements in its systems development outcomes. ?? 2012 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Little research data exist about agile teams and wellbeing. After changing our software engineering mode to agile, we wanted to find out if people experienced more or less stress than before. This study is based on a company-wide survey of 466 software engineering practitioners. We asked about their subjective feelings about stress, empowerment, and performance in their respective engineering teams after they had started to use agile methods. The results reveal that the feelings of higher performance improvement and sustainable pace are related, and that this difference is statistically significant. Respondents who feel that their team is empowered also feel less stress. However, no significant difference in feelings of stress and empowerment was found between respondents working in Kanban and Scrum mode after transition to agile. The group that was improving its performance because of agile was also reporting a better workload balance. The group that was experiencing worse performance because of agile methods was also more stressed. The differences may be explained by the management styles being practiced in the teams. The results are important as those verify in industrial setting what some agile books suggest: limiting workload and team empowerment has an impact on performance and stress. This contributes to our understanding how agile teams should be managed.},

abstract = {Agile methods are an established process for developing software nowadays. There is, however, less evidence on its usage among software practitioners in Malaysia. While the methods have become mainstream in other regions, that is not the case in this country. This paper empirically investigates the perceptions of Agile methods usage from seven organisations involving 14 software practitioners in Malaysia. Our participants are using Scrum and have a maximum of five years experience. We categorised our findings in terms of awareness, introduction, and challenges they are facing, together with the suggested and practiced solution from them. Interestingly, a change in mind set when practicing Agile was identified to be helpful in reducing the challenges. Lastly we present the practices in Agile they perceived to deliver the most benefits. We found that the use of Agile is still emerging in the country, and awareness is still lacking especially within the government sector. Although several challenges have been encountered when introducing Agile in their organisations, the benefits of Agile are reported to be in Agile practices such as: the involvement from all parties from the beginning, daily stand-up meeting, iterative and incremental, applying burn down chart, sprint and continuous integration. We aim to provide awareness and knowledge about Agile methods to the practitioners in the country and the nearby region.

The purpose of this paper is to identify strengths and barriers for 'successful agile deployment' in the software companies. This knowledge can benefit software companies planning their current strategy for agile deployment. Analysis of 57 developers, architects, project managers, customers, quality managers, and line and product managers in three case companies identifies 71 strengths and 169 barriers of agile deployment. The analysis revealed the importance of management providing the necessary goals and support for agile development. It also indicated the significance of defining a tailored process model and giving developers the freedom to improve their own agile development process continuously during agile deployment. The identified barriers, strengths and recommendations can be used as a checklist for planning and/or monitoring the effectiveness of agile deployment in software companies. By identifying the barriers and strengths of agile deployment, the paper deepens understanding of this highly relevant but relatively under-researched phenomenon and contributes to the literature on agile deployment and software process improvement. {\&}copy; 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {In recent years, there has been significant shift from rigid development (RD) toward agile. However, it has also been spotted that agile methodologies are hardly ever followed in their pure form. Hybrid processes as combinations of RD and agile practices emerge. In addition, agile adoption has been reported to result in both benefits and limitations. This exploratory study (a) identifies development models based on RD and agile practice usage by practitioners; (b) identifies agile practice adoption scenarios based on eliciting practice usage over time; (c) prioritizes agile benefits and limitations in relation to (a) and (b). Practitioners provided answers through a questionnaire. The development models are determined using hierarchical cluster analysis. The use of practices over time is captured through an interactive board with practices and time indication sliders. This study uses the extended hierarchical voting analysis framework to investigate benefit and limitation prioritization. Four types of development models and six adoption scenarios have been identified. Overall, 45 practitioners participated in the prioritization study. A common benefit among all models and adoption patterns is knowledge and learning, while high requirements on professional skills were perceived as the main limitation. Furthermore, significant variances in terms of benefits and limitations have been observed between models and adoption patterns. The most significant internal benefit categories from adopting agile are knowledge and learning, employee satisfaction, social skill development, and feedback and confidence. Professional skill-specific demands, scalability, and lack of suitability for specific product domains are the main limitations of agile practice usage. Having a balanced agile process allows to achieve a high number of benefits. With respect to adoption, a big bang transition from RD to agile leads to poor quality in comparison with the alternatives.},

@article{Murphy2013,
abstract = {Abstract—Background. The pressure to release high-quality, valuable software products at an increasingly faster rate is forcing software development organizations to adapt their development practices. Agile techniques began emerging in the mid-1990s in response to this pressure and to increased volatility of customer requirements and technical change. Theoretically, agile techniques seem to be the silver bullet for responding to these pressures on the software industry. Aims. This paper tracks the changing attitudes to agile adoption and techniques, within Microsoft, in one of the largest longitudinal surveys of its kind (2006-2012). Method. We collected the opinions of 1,969 agile and non-agile practitioners in five surveys over a six-year period. Results. The survey results reveal that despite intense market pressure, the growth of agile adoption at Microsoft is slower than would be expected. Additionally, no individual agile practice exhibited strong growth trends. We also found that while development practices of teams may be similar, some perceive and declare themselves to be following an agile methodology while others do not. Both agile and non-agile practitioners agree on the relative benefits and problem areas of agile techniques. Conclusions. We found no clear trends in practice adoption. Non-agile practitioners are less enamored of the benefits and more strongly in agreement with the problem areas. The ability for agile practices to be used by large-scale teams generally concerned all respondents, which may limit its future adoption.},

@article{Laanti2011,
abstract = {Context: Many organizations have started to deploy agile methods, but so far there exist only a few studies on organization-wide transformations. Are agile methods here to stay? Some claim that agile software development methods are in the mainstream adoption phase in the software industry, while others hope that those are a passing fad. The assumption here is that if agile would not provide real improvement, adopters would be eager at first but turn pessimistic after putting it into practice. Objective: Despite the growing amount of anecdotal evidence on the success of agile methods across a wide range of different real-life development settings, scientific studies remain scarce. Even less is known about the perception of the impacts of agile transformation when it is deployed in a very large software development environment, and whether agile methods are here to stay. This study aims to fill that gap by providing evidence from a large-scale agile transformation within Nokia. While we have yet to confirm these findings with solid quantitative data, we believe that the perception of the impacts already pinpoints the direction of the impacts of large-scale agile transformation. Method: The data were collected using a questionnaire. The population of the study contains more than 1000 respondents in seven different countries in Europe, North America, and Asia. Results: The results reveal that most respondents agree on all accounts with the generally claimed benefits of agile methods. These benefits include higher satisfaction, a feeling of effectiveness, increased quality and transparency, increased autonomy and happiness, and earlier detection of defects. Finally, 60{\%} of respondents would not like to return to the old way of working. Conclusion: While the perception of the impact of agile methods is predominantly positive, several challenge areas were discovered. However, based on this study, agile methods are here to stay. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Agile methods are an established process for developing software nowadays. There is, however, less evidence on their usage among software practitioners in Malaysia. While the methods have become mainstream in other regions, that is not the case in this country. This paper investigates important aspects in relation to Agile usage in Malaysia. The study was conducted using a questionnaire with 207 software practitioners from the country. Non parametric analysis (Chi-Square test) was conducted to investigate the relationship of Agile usage with (i) language, (ii) place of education and (iii) organization types. Results showed Agile usage has significant association with the two aspects; (i) language and (ii) organization types. It is suggested that these two aspects must be taken into consideration if one organization plans to adopt the methods. The results also revealed that many of the Agile users are not being exposed to the method before they start using it. We aim to provide knowledge and evidence on the suitability of Agile methods to the people in the country and nearby region.},

@article{Azizyan2011,
abstract = {Today, little is known about what tools software companies are using to support their Agile methods and whether they are satisfied or dissatisfied with them. This is due to lack of objective surveys on the subject. The surveys that have been conducted so far are of a subjective nature and have mostly been performed by tool vendors. They are very limited in number and focus mainly on company structure and adherence to a specific Agile method rather than on tool usage and needs. For this reason, many companies have difficulties to choose appropriate tools to support their Agile process. One such company is the Swedish telecommunications giant Ericsson. To account for this lack of data, Ericsson commissioned us to conduct an independent survey focusing on the tool usage and needs as experienced by the Agile software community today. In this paper, we report on the results of our survey. The survey covers 121 responses from 120 different companies coming from 35 different countries. Our results show that the most satisfactory tool aspect is ease of use, whereas the least satisfactory one is lack of integration with other systems. Finally, our results provide a list of features that are most desired by the software companies today.},
